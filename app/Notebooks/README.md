In addition to the notebooks themselves, a .css stylesheet is included, that modifies [nbconvert's](https://nbconvert.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) default *lab* template.
The sheet is changed from line 867 to 877 in order to display the nicely formatted JupyterLab-like view as a narrower web page.
Unfortunately, the modified file has to be swapped out directly for this mod do apply properly. A more complete solution would be a fully [custom template](https://nbconvert.readthedocs.io/en/latest/customizing.html).

The original index.css is autogenerated based on a Jinja template. The source for the styling is [here](https://github.com/jupyter/nbconvert/tree/main/share/jupyter/nbconvert/templates/lab).
