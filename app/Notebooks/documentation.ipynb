    "This repository contains the source code for use of the jointcontrol ROS package. The goal of this software is for a Reinforcement Learning (RL) model to learn the dynamics of a closed loop controller found in a robot. The trained model should then be able to set controller parameters based on the achieved plant output. The model is trained using a physics simulation and approximated version of the cascade controller found in the robot's actuators. While physics-based training is done using [the Pybullet simulator](https://pybullet.org/wordpress/), the standardised interface between environment and RL agent defined by [OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com/) was used by implementing a custom Gym environment that connects the Gym and Bullet components to each other using the [Robot Operating System (ROS)](https://www.ros.org/).\n",
    "\n",
    "The application is built in a way that allows an arbitrary number of instances of the custom Gym environment to connect to a shared simulation in Bullet. This approach allows for simultaneous training of multiple agents in multiple environments with possibly different physics properties. However, in order to ensure accuracy of the simulation, time-discrete simulation steps are performed synchronised across all active Gym environments."

    "Each algorithm can be run in an interactive JupyterLab session. Upon running the *buildandrun.sh* script, JupyterLab will be hosted and the neccesary ports will be exposed to the host machine in order to access JupyterLab [**here**](http://127.0.0.1:8888/), using a Browser of choice on the host machine. Upon the first start, JupyterLab will ask for a password; just enter *smart_control* and the session will start.\n",

    "In the session, the **Notebooks** folder can be navigated to using the browser on the left side of the page. Within this folder, there are interactive notebooks that allow training of agents based on each implemented algorithm. During training, a [Tensorboard](https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard) visualisation can be started and accessed [**here**](http://0.0.0.0:6006/#scalars) in order to visualise training progress."
